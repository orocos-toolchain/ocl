    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>
      This document describes the Orocos
      <classname>OCL::DeploymentComponent</classname> for loading and
      configuring other components using an Orocos script or XML
      file. This component can only load components into the same
      process.
    </para>
    <section>
      <title>Principle</title>
      <para>
	Each Orocos component can be compiled as a shared, dynamic loadable
	library. Each such library can define a special
	function which will allow the DeploymentComponent to create new
	instances of a component type. This principle is analogous
	to the plugin mechanism found in web browsers or other desktop
	applications.
      </para>
      <para>
	A common usage scenario of the DeploymentComponent goes as
	follows. An initial Orocos application is created which contains
	only the DeploymentComponent and the
	<classname>OCL::TaskBrowser</classname>. When the application is
	started, the TaskBrowser prompts for commands which can be given
	to the DeploymentComponent.
      </para>

	<caption><para>Components are located on your disk using the 'import' statement,
	loaded using 'loadComponents' and configured using 'configureComponents'.
	These three steps can be described in an XML file format or using the command
	prompt.
	</para></caption>
      </mediaobject>
      </figure>
      <para> 
	<xref linkend="fig-deployment-overview" /> shows the basic
	steps.  An XML file contains instructions for the
	DeploymentComponent where to look for components ('import
	statements'), which component types to create, which name they
	must be given and how their internal thread is configured
	(priorities, periods,...). Furthermore this file describes the
	network interconnections between all components and how data
	must be relayed from one component to another. The
	<function>loadComponents("file.xml")</function> method
	reads this file, looks up the components, creates them and
	stores the configuration parameters. One can apply the
	configuration (threads, properties, data connections,...) by
	calling <function>configureComponents()</function>. After this
	step, the components (and the application as a whole) can be
	started.
      </para>
      <para>
	The configuration does not need to be stored in XML format.
	One can apply the same configuration by using the scripting
	methods of the DeploymentComponent at the console prompt,
	or by listing them in an Orocos script.

	<caption><para>The Deployment component API consists of import,

      </mediaobject>
      </figure>
      <para>
	The configuration format defines the instructions one can use
	to load and configure Orocos components. One can divide the
	instructions in three groups:
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem><para>Where to look for component libraries</para></listitem>
	  <listitem><para>Which components to create and with which name</para></listitem>
	  <listitem><para>How each component is setup</para></listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
      </para>
      <para>
	Let's demonstrate this principle with a simple application
	example as shown in <xref linkend="fig-deployment-example"
	/>. We want to setup an application with three components: a
	Reporting component, a 'Controller' and a 'Plant'. The Plant
	component provides access to the hardware, the Controller
	component contains the control algorithm. The Reporting
	component is here to sense the values exchanged and write
	them to a file.
      </para>

      <section>
	<title>Where to look for component libraries</title>
	<para>
	  The <function>import</function> statement causes all
	  component libraries in a given directory to be pre-loaded.
	  It does not cause any component to be created, but
	  allows the <classname>OCL::DeploymentComponent</classname> to know where the 
	  component libraries are located. This function works recursively
	  and may be called for multiple paths.
	</para>
	<para>
	  In XML, the import statement looks like:
	  <programlisting><![CDATA[<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE properties SYSTEM "cpf.dtd">
<properties>
  <!-- ....  -->

  <simple name="Import" type="string"><value>/usr/local/lib</value></simple>

</properties>]]></programlisting>
	</para>
	<para>
	  The script method equivalent is:
	  <programlisting>  import("/usr/local/lib")</programlisting>
	</para>
	<para>
	  Each library found under the given location is pre-loaded. The
	  import statement allows you to load non-Orocos libraries as
	  well. If a library contains one or more Orocos components, 
	  the contained component types become available in the next step.
	</para>
	<para>
	  To see the effects of the import function, the available
	  types can be queried by invoking the
	  <function>displayComponentTypes</function> (script) method:
	  <screen>
 (type 'ls' for context info) :displayComponentTypes()
      Got :displayComponentTypes()
 = I can create the following component types:
   OCL::ConsoleReporting
   OCL::FileReporting
(void)</screen>
	</para>
      </section>
      <section>
	<title>Which components to create and with which name</title>
	<para>
	  Import makes components available, but does not create an
	  <emphasis>specific instance</emphasis> yet.  In order to add
	  a component of a given type to the current application,
	  use the <function>loadComponent</function> function:
	</para>
	<para>
	  In XML, the loadComponent statement of a reporting
	  component would look like:
	  <programlisting><![CDATA[<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE properties SYSTEM "cpf.dtd">
<properties>
  <!-- ... import statements locate Orocos reporting library ...  -->
  <simple name="Import" type="string"><value>/usr/local/lib</value></simple>

  <struct name="Reporter" type="OCL::FileReporting">
  </struct>

</properties>]]></programlisting>
	  This line causes the DeploymentComponent to look up
	  the OCL::FileReporting type, and if found, creates
	  a component of that type with the name "Reporter".
	  This component is added as a peer component to the
	  DeploymentComponent such that it becomes immediately
	  available to the application. This step can be
	  repeated any number of times with any number of types.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Alternatively, the type may be a filename if that file
	  contains only one component, which is exported using
	  the <function>createComponent</function> function.
	</para>
	<para>
	  The script method equivalent is:
	  <programlisting>  loadComponent("Reporter", "OCL::FileReporting")</programlisting>
	</para>
      </section>
      <section>
	<title>How each component is setup</title>
	<para>
	  Now that one or more component instances are created, you
	  can configure them by connecting components, assigning
	  threads, configuration values and program scripts. Again,
	  you can do this using XML or the scripting language.
	</para>
	<para>
	  In XML, one adds additional elements to the component
	  struct.

	<para>
	  The first section of all three components sets up the active
	  behaviour of the component. Both have periodic activities,
	  which run with a given period, priority and in a
	  scheduler. The Controller and Plant run in a real-time scheduler, the
	  Reporter doesn't. The activities are created and attached to
	  each component during the
	  <function>configureComponents()</function> step of the
	  DeploymentComponent.
	</para>
	<para>
	  The next section of the Controller contains the AutoConf and AutoStart
	  elements. If AutoConf is set to 1, the DeploymentComponent will call
	  the component's configure() method during <function>configureComponents()</function>,
	  after the properties are loaded. If AutoStart is set to 1, the component's start() 
	  method will be called during <function>startComponents()</function>.
	</para>
	<para>
	  The PropertyFile section specifies from which file each component is
	  configured.  The CPF files contain XML properties as well
	  which are read during the
	  <function>configureComponents()</function> step of the
	  DeploymentComponent.
	</para>
	<para>
	  The last section of the Reporter component lists its
	  peers. The Reporter has one peer, the Controller, with which
	  it will be able to communicate and monitor its data
	  ports. The Controller component has the Plant as peer, which
	  means it can control it. It has two data ports listed as
	  well (SensorValues and SteeringSignals), which are added to
	  two connection objects.  These connections show up in the
	  Plant component's Ports section as well. And it shows that
	  the SensorValues Port is connected to the Position Port and
	  the SteeringSignals Port is connected to the Velocity
	  Port. If other component's ports in the same file refer to
	  the same connection object, the ports are connected to each
	  other by the DeploymentComponent during the
	  <function>configureComponents()</function> step.
	  The Component Builder's Manual goes into detail about
	  the possible connection mechanisms.
	</para>
	<para>
	  The Controller has at the end two additional elements
	  describing which script files must be loaded into that
	  component. Both Orocos program scripts and state machine
	  scripts can be loaded. This is again done during the
	  <function>configureComponents()</function> step.

    <section>
      <title>Setting up a deployable component library</title>
      <para>
	This section explains how to prepare a component library
	for deployment. It is demonstrated with an example.
      </para>
      <section>
	<title>Additional Code</title>
	<para>
	  There exist three C macros for preparing a component
	  library.  The simplest way is when the resulting library
	  will contain only one component type. Assume we have written
	  the <classname>OCL::HelloWorld</classname> component ( in
	  the OCL C++ namespace) which is compiled in the
	  <filename>orocos-helloworld.so</filename> library. The
	  following code is added to HelloWorld.cpp:
	</para>
	<programlisting>  #include "HelloWorld.hpp"
  #include &lt;ocl/ComponentLoader.hpp&gt;

  /* ... Hello World implementation file ... */

  // You <emphasis>must</emphasis> specify the namespace:
  ORO_CREATE_COMPONENT( OCL::HelloWorld )</programlisting>
         <para>
	   This macro inserts a function into the library which will
	   allow the DeploymentComponent to create OCL::HelloWorld components.
	 </para>
	 <para>
	   In case multiple components are defined in the same
	   library, two other macros must be used. One macro for each
	   component type and one macro once for the whole
	   library. Say your library has components
	   NS::<classname>ComponentX</classname> and
	   NS::<classname>ComponentZ</classname> in namespace NS. In
	   order to export both components, you could write in
	   <filename>ComponentX.cpp</filename>:
	 </para>
	<programlisting>  #include "ComponentX.hpp"
  #include &lt;ocl/ComponentLoader.hpp&gt;

  /* ... ComponentX implementation file ... */
  // <emphasis>once</emphasis>:
  ORO_CREATE_COMPONENT_TYPE
  // <emphasis>For the ComponentX type</emphasis>:
  ORO_LIST_COMPONENT_TYPE( NS::ComponentX )</programlisting>
         <para>
	   and in <filename>ComponentY.cpp</filename> the same but without the
	   ORO_CREATE_COMPONENT_TYPE macro:
	 </para>
	<programlisting>  #include "ComponentY.hpp"
  #include &lt;ocl/ComponentLoader.hpp&gt;

  /* ... ComponentY implementation file ... */

  // <emphasis>For the ComponentY type</emphasis>:
  ORO_LIST_COMPONENT_TYPE( NS::ComponentY )</programlisting>
         <para>
	   For each additional component in the same library,
	   the ORO_LIST_COMPONENT_TYPE macro is added. It is
	   allowed to put all the ORO_LIST_COMPONENT_TYPE macros
	   in a single file. 
	 </para>
      </section>
      <section>
	<title>Compiling and linking a component library</title>
	<para>
	  In order to have a working library, care must be taken
	  of the compilation flags. You may compile your library
	  static or shared. But a static library will not be
	  dynamically loadable. In the final executable the
	  DeploymentComponent will be able to find the linked in
	  components and setup the application using the XML file.
	</para>
	<para>
	  The macros need some help to figure out if you are 
	  compiling a shared or static library. You need to define
	  the OCL_DLL_EXPORT macro when compiling for a shared
	  library. If this macro is not defined, it is assumed
	  that you are compiling for a static library.
	</para>
	<para>
	  The compilation flag of a component for a shared library
	  might look like:
	</para>
	<programlisting>  CFLAGS= -O2 -Wall -fPIC -DOCL_DLL_EXPORT
  LDFLAGS= -fPIC</programlisting>
	<para>
	  The compilation flag of a component for a static library
	  lacks both options :
	</para>
	<programlisting>  CFLAGS= -O2 -Wall
  LDFLAGS=</programlisting>
